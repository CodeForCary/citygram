##About

Are you a homeowner curious about construction on your street? How about the new restaurant going in down the block? Want to know when there's going to be electrical work in your area?

Enter Citygram. Citygram is a notifications system for subscribing to your city, whether it's foreclosures in your neighborhood or building permits along your commute. With Citygram, you can sign up for notifications about the things that matter to you _where_ they matter to you in your city.
